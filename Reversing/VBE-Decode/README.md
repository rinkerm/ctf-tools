### VBE-Decode

This program is the result of watching a John Hammond video where he uses a tool to decode vbe scripts.

I took the broken script he found during his video **[here](https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/decode-vbe.py)**

Note: Since his video came out he has also uploaded his own version on his github **[here](https://github.com/JohnHammond/vbe-decoder/blob/master/vbe-decoder.py)**

This tool is mainly a product of my own learning about vbe scripts and their encoding.

```
Usage: vbe-decode.py [-h] [-i I] [-v V] [-o O]
